# HTML: The Essentials

## Introduction to HTML

### About HTML:

- HTML is markup language not a programming language.
- 1989/90 HTML was created to help describe structure of academic research papers.
- HTML is nothing but instructions to browser on how display content.
  For example,
- Make this part bold
- Make this part of link
- Make this a paragraph

### HTML elements

- To write HTML, we use HTML elements.

Some examples of HTML elements:

- `<p>` element: represents a paragraph of text
- `<h1>` element: represents the main header of the page
- `<img>` element: embeds an image
- `<form>` element: represents a form

Syntax:

`<p>I am a paragraph</p>`

- `<p>` : It is an opening tag
- `</p>`: It is a closing tag

## Our very first HTML page

- Trying to replicate part of wikipedia page about chickens with HTML.
- If you don't close a tag, browser assumes that everything from there till the end needs to be bolded.

## About Mozilla Developer Network

- Resources that covers about web technologies.
- Link: developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
- Mozilla is not the creater of HTML, CSS or Javascript.
- But, it is like a wiki to these technologies.

## Paragraph elements

- Update the HTML file with `<p>` tags.
- It is fine to nest tags with in them.
- `<p>` tag is used to mark it as a paragraph.

## Heading elements

- Update the HTML file with heading tags.
- There are 6 levels of headings starting with h1 upto h6.
- Heading elements shouldn't be used for size.
- They should be used as per the hierarchy as we change sizes of them using CSS.
- For example, we should try to keep a maximum of one h1 tag.
