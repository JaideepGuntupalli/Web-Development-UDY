## Block vs Inline

- Block level elements take up a whole "block" of space
- _Examples:_ Paragraph elements, Heading elements, etc
- Inline elements fit along side other elements
- _Examples:_ Anchor tags, Image elements, etc

## Divs & Spans

- Div tag(`<div></div>`) or The content division element is a generic container for flow content. It has on effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.
- It is a block level element
- So, if they are multiple inline elements and some of them are put in div, then they take take their own line or block
- Span tag (`<span></span>`) is also a generic container as div but it is an inline element.

## HR, BR, Sup, & Sub tags

- `<hr>`: It is a horizontal divider. They dont have a closing tag.
- `<br>`: Instead of multiple paragraphs, we can use `<br>` to add next line to the paragraphs. They dont have a closing tag.
- `<sup></sup>`: Makes the element render above the word like square in a math equation.
- `<sub></sub>`: Makes the element render below the word like an equation of a chemical compound.
